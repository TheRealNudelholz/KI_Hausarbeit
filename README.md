# Neuronal Net Java Implementation

This implementation should teach you, how a basic neural net and pruning methods work.

## Usage

Within the package Testing are methods to explore the neural nets behaviour with various hyperparameters and pruning methods.

## Classes

### Neuron: 
The representation of a neuron containing incoming and outgoing connections.
### Connection:
The representation of a connection between two neurons.
### Layer:
The representation of a layer containing nodes.
### Net: 
The representation of a net containing layers, connections and methods for training and prediction.
### Pruner: 
Containing methods to prune given layers and connections.
### Activation: 
Containing methods to calculate a nodes activation and partial derivative.
